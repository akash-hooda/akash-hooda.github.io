I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India. I am currently working on my undergraduate thesis at the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Defence Research and Development Organization, India under the supervision of Sci-F Faheema AGJ. I am working on perception and navigation techniques for autonomous robotic systems. 

Broadly, I would describe my research interests to lie in the convergent point of robotics, embedded systems, signal processing and machine learning. Most importantly, I truly enjoy bringing theoretical concepts into life through their practical implementations. I am motivated to use these to have a direct  positive impact on our daily lives.  

I have been fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to collaborate and work with very knowledgable and talented experts. I had the opportunity to work in Spectrum Lab, Indian Institute of Science, under the guidance of Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula in the domains of inverse problems, optimization and image reconstruction. I have alsoBefore that, I had the opportunity to work in embedded system design with Mr. Uday Kandekar at Aurobindo EmbChip Technologies.
