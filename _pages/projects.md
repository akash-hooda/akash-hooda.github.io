# My Projects

- COVID-19 detection system using chest X-Ray images
The Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, DRDO. **Guide:** Sci-F. Faheem AGJ.
    - Development of an accurate, reliable and robust COVID-19 diagnosis software aimed at reducing the burden placed on doctors, due to the high number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. I worked on the backend inference software, that exhibited improvements in classification metrics, speed of diagnosis, and the presence of safety check measures that helped reduce the number of false positives, false negatives, and improve the overall reliability of the software. 
    - Coded and Implemented in Python using TensorFlow deep learning library.
- Hepato-Cellular Carcinoma grading using H\&E stained liver histopathology images
National Institute of Technology Karnataka. **Guide:** Prof. Shyam Lal.
    - Design and development of a novel deep learning framework for the automatic HCC grading of H\&E stained liver histopathology images.
    - This novel architecture outperforms other competitive frameworks both in quality of detection and in effeciency: memory requirement and computational complexity.
    - Coded and Implemented in Python and Keras deep learning library with TensorFlow backend. 
    - Publication under review: 
    [TODO]
- An effecient deep learning architecture for nuclei segmentation in histopathology images 
National Institute of Technology Karnataka. **Guide:** Prof. Shyam Lal.
    - Design and simulation of a novel segmentation network for robust nuclei segmentation from H\&E stained histopathology images. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated this on breast and kidney tissue. 
    - Coded and Implemented in Python and PyTorch deep learning library. 
    - **Publication currently under review:**
    **Anirudh Ashok Aatresh**, Rohit Prashant Yatgiri, Amit Kumar Chanchal, Aman Kumar, Akansh Ravi,Devikalyan Das, Raghavendra BS, Shyam Lal, and Jyoti Kini. Kidneynet: Efficient encoderâ€“decoderarchitecture with dimension-wise pyramid pooling for nuclei segmentation of histopathology images.Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics, 2020.

- Formulation of novel weight updation approaches for reweighted total variation regularization
Spectrum Lab, Indian Institute of Science. **Guide:** Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula, Mr. Praveen Pokala. 
    - The formulation of novel weight updation approaches for improved total variation regularization. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated improved performance in image denoising, image deblurring and image reconstruction on diffusercam lensless camera.
    - Coded and Implemented using Python and MATLAB.

- Seeing Through Sound
IEEE NITK 
    - A study performed to compare viable approaches to convert image and video data to sound. The main application of this method is to aid the visually impaired in perceiving their environment through sound
    - We compared two competitive approaches: "vOICe algorithm" VS. "image captioning and text to speech conversion".
    - Coded and Implemented using Python and PyTorch deep learning library.

- Time unfolded optimization for improved image reconstruction quality in diffusercam lensless camera
Spectrum Lab, Indian Institute of Science. **Guide:** Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula, Mr. Praveen Pokala. 
    - I worked on the development of a time unfolded optimization to obtain improved image reconstruction quality for diffusercam lensless camera. Worked on implementing linear expansion of thresholds(LET) for better regularization performance. 
    - Coded and implemented time unfolded optimzation neural networks using Python and PyTorch deep learning framework. 

- LED Wall
Technites technical Club, NITK
    - Building a real time audio to "LED Array" conversion system to convert live audio input to a frequency domain representation, that is further visualized using a giant LED array. 
    - Coded and Implemented using Embedded C and Python. 

- Image reconstruction algorithms for diffusercam and flatcam lensless cameras
Spectrum Lab, Indian Institute of Science. **Guide:** Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula, Mr. Praveen Pokala. 
    - Performed a study on regularization approaches for image reconstruction algorithms for diffusercam and flatcam lensless cameras. 
    - Explored various regularization approaches such as L1 regularization, L2 regularization, total variation regularization and regularization by denoising(RED). I also explored various denoising algorithms such as BM3D and wavelet domain thresholding. 
    - Coded and implemented in Python and MATLAB.

- Quadraped Walking Robot
Robocon 2019
    - Development and implementation of PID control algorithms for the walking mechanism of the Quadraped robot build for Robocon 2019.
